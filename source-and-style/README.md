##The website uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can confirm this because I found multiple files ending in .css and .js under the "Sources" tab of the browser's developer tools. Additionally, when inspecting the website through the "Elements" tab, I see the tag <html lang="en">, which indicates that HTML is the main markup language being used to build the website. Besides these, there are also image files with formats such as .svg, .jpg, and .png, which shows that the site uses images as well.

##When I checked the "Network" tab, I found several image files being loaded, including .jpg, .png, and .svg formats. These files correspond to various images displayed on the website, such as "Pathsala.jpg," "Sodh-Sindhu.jpg," and "Swayam.jpg." Additionally, I noticed the use of jQuery, a popular JavaScript library, which shows that the website uses this for interactivity. The network data highlights the use of JavaScript to load these image resources dynamically. 

##After analyzing the National Digital Library of India (NDLI) website using BuiltWith.com, I found that the site is linked to the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur), as its top-ranking domain is iitkgp.ac.in. 
The site utilizes a range of web technologies, including PHP, Java EE, and jQuery, which are commonly used for large, scalable projects.
Additionally, the site uses Google Analytics for visitor tracking and engagement analysis, Font Awesome for its icons and visuals, and YouTube for embedding videos. 
Though there isnâ€™t a specific number of people listed, it's clear that maintaining and scaling a site of this complexity likely requires the collaboration of various roles, including web developers, system administrators, content managers, and project leads.
