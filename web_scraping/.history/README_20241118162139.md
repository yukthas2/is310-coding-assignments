# Web Scraping Assignment

## Fandom Wiki Selection
I chose the [Harry Potter Fandom Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com) because I am interested in exploring the character pages to gather information about various characters in the Harry Potter universe, since it has been my favorite book and movies series growing up. This project involves scraping data from the Harry Potter Fandom Wiki to collect character names categorized by their year of birth. The Harry Potter universe is rich with lore, spanning multiple generations of witches, wizards, and magical creatures. This depth makes it an intriguing dataset for analysis, particularly when exploring characters' backgrounds and how they fit within the series' timeline.

## What I am Scraping
From the "Individuals by Year of Birth" category, I am scraping:

Character Names: A complete list of names of the characters sorted by their birth year.
The focus on year of birth is particularly interesting because it allows for a chronological understanding of the characters' place in the story. This timeline data could be valuable for researchers examining the impact of generational differences on the events within the series.

## Why this data is useful 
Literary Analysis: Researchers studying the Harry Potter series can use this data to look at generational patterns and how they affect the story. Knowing when characters were born in relation to major events can provide insights into their motivations and relationships.
Cultural Studies: Scholars exploring the cultural impact of Harry Potter can analyze how different age groups are portrayed and their significance in the narrative.
Data Visualization: The timeline of character births can be turned into visual projects that highlight connections between characters and key events in the series.
