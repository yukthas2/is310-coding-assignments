# Web Scraping Assignment

## Fandom Wiki Selection
I chose the [Harry Potter Fandom Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com) because I am interested in exploring the character pages to gather information about various characters in the Harry Potter universe, since it has been my favorite book and movies series growing up. This project involves scraping data from the Harry Potter Fandom Wiki to collect character names categorized by their year of birth. The Harry Potter universe is rich with lore, spanning multiple generations of witches, wizards, and magical creatures. This depth makes it an intriguing dataset for analysis, particularly when exploring characters' backgrounds and how they fit within the series' timeline.
