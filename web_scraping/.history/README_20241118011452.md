# Web Scraping Assignment

## Fandom Wiki Selection
I chose the [Harry Potter Fandom Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com) because I am interested in exploring the character pages to gather information about various characters in the Harry Potter universe, since it has been my favorite book and movies series growing up. This data could be of interest to researchers studying the cultural impact of the series or for creating a database of character traits and relationships.
